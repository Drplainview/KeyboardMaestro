Collection of Keyboard Maestro Macros

### OmniFocus Perspectives Macros

![omnifocus-perspectives-preview](http://cl.ly/LwAM/omnifocus-perspectives-preview.jpg)

A palette that can be triggered via a global hotkey and displays your favorite OmniFocus perspectives.

If OmniFocus isn't running it will be openend with the selected perspective.

Customize the macro by using the names of your own OmniFocus perspectives and hotkeys that work for you.

### OmniFocus Scripts Palette

This is a collection of all the scripts I use with Keyboard Maestro and OmniFocus. The people who made these scripts are collected in a reference list in [this blog post](http://rocketink.net/2013/01/keyboard-maestro-as-omnifocus%27s-little-helper.html).

### Bookmarklets

I doubt they are interesting for anyone, but maybe it's shorter for you to copy and paste in your own bookmarklets than starting from scratch. Anyway [here] is the corresponing post to these 2 macro collections.
